    <p>
    I'm a 22 year old freshman from England. I've been in the US for 3 weeks. I'm a software engineering major,<br> hoping to get into some sort of development. I enjoy skateboarding, playing soccer and playing online games<br> with my friends. I've been a member my whole life but only become active again in the past year. I have 2<br> siblings, an older sister and a younger brother. I worked for 3 years as airport security before deciding to come to BYU-I.<br> I'm currently really enjoying being in Rexburg and at BYU-I, the environment is friendly and welcoming.
